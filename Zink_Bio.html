            It all started in 1985 when the Zink family received the Nintendo Entertainment System as a family gift for Christmas.  Larry slid in the Super Mario Bros. game cartridge and he was hooked after that.  Having two older brothers didn't deter his determination to play everyday.  He'd wake up hours earlier than everyone else at his home to quietly play in the dark. He'd do odd jobs for neighbors, saving up money until he could purchase the game or system he wanted as the years went.  Then he was introduced to online gaming on January 5th, 2000.  A date seered into his mind for all eternity.  Larry's oldest brother, Joe, helped Larry create his first character on the game EverQuest, and his mind was blown.  Countless hours were spent playing.  Setting alarm clocks during the night so he could catch rare spawns, rushing home from school to maximize the time he spent playing, and making friendships with people all over the United States via the game.  The interaction the game provided made him a complete addict.

            He has played countless mmorpg games, and owns and has played hundreds of games on just about every console imaginable.  His game collection also extends to a large number of games in Japanese and he has a number of Japanese gaming systems as well.  As of right now, he has been rather nostalgic and has started playing EverQuest again.  He has also been playing Lunar on the Play Station.  For more recently made games, he regularly plays the mmorpg Final Fantasy XIV and has a severe addiction to the mobile game Dissidia Final Fantasy Opera Omnia.

        Larry started collecting SNES games, specifically RPGs (role-playing games), when he was around 13 years old.  Then he began collecting figures when he was 16 starting with the release of Final Fantasy 8.  Most of his collection has been largely based around RPG games that he has loved over the years.  He has countless figures from all of the Final Fantasy series as well as a plethora of plushies that were produced by Square Enix.  He also owns hundreds of games, starting with the NES and leading up to the Play Station 4.  There are countless collector's editions that are still in their original packaging and have never been opened.  The games and figures he collects are from all over the world.  His love for RPGs and collecting things associated with them is what led to him collecting cards from the trading card game Final Fantasy.  Currently he owns all but 1 promo card ever made for the game, and hopes to eventually finish his collection.  The one remaining card is exceptionally rare.  The last time there was a record of one sold was over a year ago, and it sold for over $1,000.  Larry plans to continue his RPG collection as well.  He still has many games and figures he'd like to add over the years, and there will likely be many new things that come out as well.

    <h3>Final Fantasy TCG</h3>
      <img src="images/fftcg.jpg" alt="FFTCG" width="200" align="right">
      <p>
        Initially, there was never any intention to actually play this game.  Larry and his wife learned that Final Fantasy had trading cards and the original idea was to buy cards specifically just for collecting. While visiting different shops looking for one that sold the cards, they stopped in one shop where people were in the middle of playing the game.  When they learned of Larry's love the Final Fantasy series, they offered to show him and his wife how to play.  After that, they were visiting that shop every week just to continue learning how to play.

        After about a year of playing FFTCG (Final Fantasy Trading Card Game), the Phoenix FFTCG community was beginning to grow considerably.  Previously they had done a Circuit for tournaments around town, but the person who used to run it was no longer able.  Larry and his wife stepped up to the plate and took over the Circuit and this later led to them overall running the majority of events throughout the Phoenix area.  The prizing and events that they planned for their local community events and shared on Facebook ended up catching national attention, and a number of players throughout North America requested that Phoenix be chosen for an FFTCG sponsored event.  Not long after, Phoenix was chosen as one of only six locations throughout all of North America to host a Crystal Cup event.  These events allow the winner an invitation to the World FFTCG tournament as well as free travel and room and board.  The World event takes place somewhere different every year.  The first year it took place in Japan, and next year it will take place in Singapore, so these events are highly sought after.  During this event, one of the local players earned the World invite helping to further put Phoenix on the FFTCG map.  Larry continues to assist with events and prizing and the Phoenix area has already been promised another national event that will take place in August 2020.

        Larry is orignally from Omaha, Nebraska but currently resides in Mesa, Arizona. His work with his employer PayPal is what brought him over to the Grand Canyon state.  He has been married to his wife, Cassandra, for 10 years and they have 2 adorable cats together. At least they are adorable sometimes, like when they're sleeping.  Larry and his wife play video games and card games together regularly, but they also enjoy going on marathon tv show watching sprees.  Larry focuses a lot of his time towards video games in general.  That includes playing as well as trying to develop different games on different platforms.  Gaming isn't the only thing that he enjoys though.  Larry also enjoys playing sand volleyball and going for the occasional bike ride.  He's also a big fan of Harry Potter and has gone to Universal Studios in Florida as well as in California numerous times to get his Harry Potter fix.  Because of his love for video games, he has also been very interested in Japanese culture for numerous years and has visited different areas of Japan three different times so far and plans on there being many more trips in the future.

            His primary goal at this time is to focus on different projects that might be able to add additional income.  Ideally, this would eventually lead to him making enough additional income that he can free himself from working for "the man".  Right now Larry has numerous different gaming projects that he's been working on with the hopes that eventually something will catch the eyes of either gamers or game developers. He is also starting to focus on a long-term goal he has to eventually move to Japan. Right now his primary focus is learning the language and educating himself more on the culture.   If he is able to communicate relatively fluently, it makes getting a job in Japan much easier.  Also, learning the language and potentially living there would be a great opportunity to work with game developers from that region as well!
